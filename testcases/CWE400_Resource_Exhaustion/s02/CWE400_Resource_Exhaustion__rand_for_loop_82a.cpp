 * @description
 * CWE: 400 Resource Exhaustion
 * BadSource: rand Set data to result of rand(), which may be zero
 * GoodSource: Assign count to be a relatively small number
 * Sinks: for_loop
 *    GoodSink: Validate count before using it as the loop variant in a for loop
 *    BadSink : Use count as the loop variant in a for loop
 * Flow Variant: 82 Data flow: data passed in a parameter to an virtual method called via a pointer
